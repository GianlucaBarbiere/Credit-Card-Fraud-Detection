# Introduction
Credit card fraud remains a significant concern for both financial institutions and cardholders worldwide. The proliferation of online transactions and electronic payments has created new opportunities for fraudulent activities. To combat this issue, data science plays a vital role in developing robust fraud detection systems. This project is dedicated to the analysis of credit card transaction data with the goal of identifying fraudulent transactions. Two supervised learning models, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees, have been trained and evaluated to enhance fraud detection accuracy.
